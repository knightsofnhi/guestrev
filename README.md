Example: Cendyn - Operations Monitoring Tool

A custom, operations monitoring tool that connects to Cendyn's third-party database and displays the data in an easy-to-read table that was specifically created for Cendyn's development and support team.

The Problem: The company deals with third-party databases that hold clientele information that update on a daily basis. The company's development and support team need to be able to view the data and be able to make adjustments that will also update the third-party database in real-time. Unfortunately, the departments in need of this tool does not specialize in web-based applications nor does their third-party vendor. The managers tried to look for a solution online, but they lacked web development knowledge to even know what tool to use let alone how to use it.

The Solution: GuestRev Pro sat down with a Cendyn representative to listen to their needs and provide a custom, web-based solution that is simple to use and easy to understand. From start to finish, GuestRev Pro ensured a final product that would save Cendyn's development and support departments a lot of time by giving them the exact solution for their problem. GuestRev Pro also configured the company's third-party database with its custom operations monitoring tool to make sure everything is up and running for Cendyn's development and support departments. Every step of the process is done with confidentiality and ongoing product support, which is rare if not unavailable in this day and age of big, untrustworthy corporations, such as Google and Amazon, monopolizing on all web-based tools that aren't user-friendly to non-web professionals.
