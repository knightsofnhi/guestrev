Example: Cendyn - Operations Monitoring Tool

A custom, operations monitoring tool that connects to Cendyn's third-party database and displays the data in an easy-to-read table that was specifically created for Cendyn's development and support teams.

The Problem: The company deals with third-party databases that hold clientele information that update on a daily basis. The company's development and support teams need to be able to view the data and make adjustments that will also update the third-party database in real-time. Unfortunately, the departments in need of this tool does not specialize in web-based applications nor does their third-party vendor. The managers tried to look for a solution online, but they lacked web development knowledge to even know what tool to use let alone how to use it effectively and securely.

The Solution: GuestRev Pro sat down with a Cendyn representative to listen to their needs and provide a custom, web-based solution that is simple to use and easy to understand. From start to finish, GuestRev Pro ensured a final product that would save Cendyn's development and support teams a lot of time by giving them the exact solution for their specific need. GuestRev Pro also configured the company's third-party database with its custom operations monitoring tool to make sure everything is up and running for Cendyn's development and support departments. Every step of the process was done with confidentiality and product support. GuestRev Pro provides a rare service for those who wish to not give away their data and their clients' data to big corporations, such as Google and Amazon, that hold a monopoly on web-based tools that are not user-friendly to non-web professionals nor are they trustworthy with people's data.
