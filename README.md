Example: GuestRev Operations Monitoring Tool

A custom, operations monitoring tool that connects to a client's third-party database and displays the data in an easy-to-read table that was specifically created for the client's development and support teams.

The Problem: The client deals with a third-party database that holds classified information, which updates on a daily basis. The client's development and support teams needed to be able to view the data in real-time and make adjustments that will also update the database in real-time. Unfortunately, the departments in need of this tool did not specialize in web-based applications nor did their third-party vendor. The managers tried to look for a solution online, but they lacked web development knowledge to even know what tool to use let alone how to use it effectively and securely. The scale of the project was also not big enough to validate a big purchase of software that would also cost a large amount of time for the client's employees to stop their usual work to learn from scratch.

The Solution: C1App sat down with the client to listen to their needs and provide a custom, web-based solution that is simple to use and easy to understand. From start to finish, C1App ensured a final product that would save the client's development and support teams a lot of time by giving them the exact solution for their specific task. Special configuration of the third-party database and the custom operations monitoring tool is available to make sure everything is up and running for the client's development and support departments. Every step of the process was done with confidentiality and support. 

C1App provides a rare, custom web-based application service for those who wish to choose a more private alternative to big-data corporations that hold a monopoly on web-based tools that are not user-friendly to non-web professionals.
