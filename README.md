Example: GuestRev Operations Monitoring Tool

A custom, operations monitoring tool that connects to a client's third-party database and displays the data in an easy-to-read table that was specifically created for the client's development and support teams.

The Problem: The client deals with a third-party database that holds classified information, which updates on a daily basis. The client's development and support teams needed to be able to view the data in real-time and make adjustments that will also update the database in real-time. ]The scale of the project was not big enough to validate a big purchase of software just to use one feature and it would have cost too much time for the client's employees to stop their usual work to learn from scratch.

The Solution: Only1App sat down with the client to listen to their needs and provide a custom, web-based solution that is simple to use and easy to understand. From start to finish, Only1App ensured a final product that would save the client's development and support teams a lot of time by giving them the exact solution for their specific task. Special configuration of the third-party database and the custom operations monitoring tool is available to make sure everything is up and running for the client's development and support departments. Every step of the process would be done with confidentiality and support. 

Only1App provides a rare, custom web-based application service for those who wish to choose a more private alternative to big-data corporations that hold a monopoly on web-based tools that are not user-friendly to non-web professionals.
